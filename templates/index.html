        Using Machine learning, our application utilizes a Kaggle dataset to predict the outcomes of
        horses' health conditions. By analyzing various factors, we provide insights into whether a horse is likely to
        live, face euthanasia, or unfortunately, succumb to its health challenges. This user-friendly tool aims to
        assist veterinarians, horse owners, and enthusiasts in making informed decisions about the well-being of these
        magnificent animals. Explore the future of equine health with our predictive model!
